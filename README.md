# Lab Report
## OpenGL Realtime Ray Tracing Lab
### My Objective
I first heard about ray tracing in a game trailer, which shows the different effects between the usual way of shading and ray tracing. It seemed to be a very advanced technology and I thought it was too early for me to learn about it. When I saw this course, I immediately have the desire to take it. I also want to make ray tracing real-time as I'm more interested in games than movies. That's why I decide to work on this project.
In my project, I wish to have a scene that contains a number of objects, each having different material. I can click and drag my mouse to rotate around the objects.
