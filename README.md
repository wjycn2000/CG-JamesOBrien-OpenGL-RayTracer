# Lab Report
## OpenGL Realtime Ray Tracing Lab
### My Objective
I first heard about ray tracing in a game trailer, which shows the different effects between the rasterization and ray tracing. It seemed to be a very advanced technology and I thought it was too early for me to learn about it. When I saw this course, I immediately have the desire to take it. I also want to make ray tracing real-time as I'm more interested in games than movies. That's why I decide to work on this project.
In my project, I wish to have a scene that contains a number of objects, each having different material. I can click and drag my mouse to rotate the camera around the objects, looking at the scene from different angles.

### My Progress
###### make a runnable program
I was thinking about using BVH tree to accelerate ray tracing. I also want to have a hirachical scene. But these ideas slow me down. At the same time, I am not quite sure if using OpenGL to ray trace really works. So I decided to start from a very simple program. There is no scene and no tree.
